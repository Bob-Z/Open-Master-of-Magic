	Modifying Master of Magic
		    Kenneth M. Dale	Rev. C	1/21/99

1.  Introduction

The computer files of Master of Magic (MOM) contain a vast amount of data on
the various units, races and spells in the game.  This document lists the
addresses of the unit and race data and enchantment upkeep costs in the
WIZARDS.EXE file for MOM version 1.3.1.  Earlier MOM versions have the same
or similar data, but at different addresses.  It is possible to change the
attributes of units and races, and costs of units and spells in the game by
changing certain bytes in the file.

In order to make the changes, you will need an editor program for binary
files.  These programs are often called "hex editors" because the data bytes
and addresses are listed as hexadecimal (base 16) numbers.  If you are not
familiar with hex editors, try getting help from an experienced programmer.
Also, be sure to make a backup of WIZARDS.EXE before modifying it.  You can
copy WIZARDS.EXE to any file name for backup, but beware of using WIZARDS.BAK
as the name.  Some editors will automatically overwrite WIZARDS.BAK every
time you save.  To check your work you can use the DOS or Windows FC program
to do a binary comparison of your backup file and your edited file.  The
command FC /B WIZARDS.131 WIZARDS.EXE >WIZCHNG.TXT or similar should list
your changes to a text file.

As an example of what to do, let's say that we think Minotaurs would look
more impressive with 4 figures instead of 2, but we had better reduce some of
their stats for game balance.  Looking at the Beastmen normal units, we find
that the data for Minotaurs start at 029E1C.  We will change the + to hit
(byte 6) to zero, the hit points per figure (byte 12) to 6 and the number of
figures (byte 15) to 4.  Using hexadecimal addition to find the addresses, we
change byte 029E22 from 02 to 00, byte 029E2E from 0C to 06, and byte 029E31
from 02 to 04.  When we save the file and restart MOM, we find that Minotaur
units (including those in previously saved games) now have 4 figures.

6.  Unit Structure Byte Descriptions

0,1	Pointer to name of unit type (note 1)

  4	Ranged attack type (table 1)
  5	Ranged attack number of shots
  6	Plus to hit

A,B	Heroes: cost to hire (note 2)  Normal units: cost to build  Summoned
	units: cost to place in lair, node or rampaging force (note 3)
  C	Summoned units: upkeep cost  Others: not used (note 4)
  D	Race code (table 2)
E,F	Normal units: buildings required (table 3)  Others: note 5
 10	Heroes: type code?  Others: ???
 11	00
 12	Hit points (hearts) per figure
 13	Scouting range
 14	Transport capacity (number of units carried)
 15	Number of figures in the unit
 16	Construction capacity (road building)
 17	Special attack or bonus strength
 18	Movement flags (table 4)
 19	00
 1A	Immunity flags (table 5)
 1B	Attribute flags (table 6)
 1C	Attribute flags (table 7)
 1D	00
 1E	Attribute flags (table 8)
 1F	Attribute flags (table 9)
 20	Special attack flags (table 10)
 21	Special attack flags (table 11)
 22	00
 23	00

Note 1: To find the string constant address from the pointer, form a 4 hex
	digit number from byte 1 followed by byte 0 and add 294A0.  For
	example, bytes 0 and 1 for Brax are D3 21.  Adding 21D3 and 294A0
	produces 2B673, the address of the string "Dwarf".

Note 2: The cost to hire a hero also determines the fame needed.  The fame
	level is (hire_cost - 100.) / 10. rounded down.

Note 3:	The cost in the unit table is not used for units summoned by a wizard.
	The mana cost to cast each spell (including summoning spells) is in
	the file SPELLDAT.LBX at bytes 1A and 1B after the start of each
	spell name.  For example, the string "Demon Lord" starts at 1E44.
	Bytes 1E5E and 1E5F are E8 03.  03E8 hex is 1000 decimal, which is
	the cost to summon a Demon Lord.  Editing SPELLDAT.LBX will change
	the spells in the game.  Editing the costs in the unit tables should
	change the average number of creatures in lairs.

Note 4: The upkeep cost for heroes is ceil(hire_cost / 50.) unless the hero
	has the Noble attribute.  The upkeep cost for normal units is
	ceil(build_cost / 50.), except that the first type for each race has
	zero cost.

Note 5:	Bytes E and F are 06 00 for summoned units.  For heroes byte E is
	unique to each hero.  Byte F is used to initialize the artifact slot
	type (00 sword/shield/ring, 01 bow/shield/ring, 02 mixed/shield/ring,
	03 wand/ring/ring).  Once the hero has been acquired, the artifact
	slots are stored in the game save file and can be changed there.

Note 6: This is the order the buildings are listed in BUILDDAT.LBX, and
	corresponds to the unit table codes for those buildings which are
	required for normal units.

Note 7: This bit is set for all cavalry type units.  Its effect is unknown.

Note 8: This bit is set for standard units (spearmen, swordsmen, etc).  It
	causes the race name to be listed before the unit name on the unit
	display window.  It may be set for any normal or summoned unit to
	list the race or magic realm name.  It has no effect on heroes.

Note 9: This bit is set for all flying units, but clearing it has no apparent
	effect on the unit.

Note 10:This bit is set for all summoned units.  It controls a) whether upkeep
	is in mana or gold+food, but does not change how upkeep is calculated
	(byte C in the unit structure for summoned units, note 4 for normal
	units), b) whether certain spells can be cast on the unit (clearing
	this bit for a summoned unit allows you to cast Heroism, Holy Weapon
	etc. on the unit), and c) whether the unit can gain experience.  This
	bit may have other effects as well (such as "ignore weapon immunity").

Note 11:Setting this bit puts "Land Corruption" on the unit's display.  There
	is a help window for land corruption, but the ability does not work
	as stated in the window.  Probably the program code for the land
	corruption ability has been removed.

8.  Race structure byte descriptions

Bytes 2 through 17 form two byte signed integers with the low order byte first
so that 7 is stored as 07 00.  Negative numbers are represented by the two's
complement so that -1 is stored as FF FF and -2 as FE FF.  Prohibiting a
building makes all buildings that depend on it inaccessible, so they do not
need to be in the prohibited list.

0,1	Pointer to name of race (note 1)
2,3	Number of prohibited buildings (0 to 7)
4,5	First prohibited building (table 3) (ignored if number is 0)

9.  Upkeep costs of enchantments

These are stored as two byte positive integers, but only the first byte
(the low order byte) is nonzero since none of the values exceeds 255.
